# CLAUDE.md

This file is a map, not a manual. It points to where authoritative information
lives so there is a single source of truth for each topic. When a pointer here
and a linked document disagree, the linked document wins. Correct this file
accordingly.

## Start here

- What this repository is: [`README.md`](README.md). It is the `microservice-arena`
  repository of The Test Cabinet, a repository of kind `application`.
- The documentation of The Test Cabinet is the source of truth, and it lives
  in the superrepo's documentation site, never here. Checked out inside the
  superrepo, its pages are under `../apps/docs/src/content/docs/`, and the
  Repositories page, `../apps/docs/src/content/docs/development/repositories.md`,
  draws the edges between the repositories and links the component pages that
  govern each.
- This repository documents its own code with rustdoc and its README. It
  never restates what the documentation site states; it links the page.
- Issues are filed on the superrepo's one board, through its issues server,
  never here.

## Repository layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`.claude/`](.claude/README.md) | The harness's settings, its gate hooks and the `coding` skill |
| `crates/` | The Rust crates; every directory here is a workspace member |
| `packages/`, `apps/` | The npm workspace's members, under the root `package.json` |
| [`ci/`](ci/README.md) | The gates, one file per gate, with the runner that executes them |
| `.copier-answers.yml` | The answers this repository was rendered with and the superrepo commit its kit was last updated from; copier maintains it, and `scripts/repos/render.py --update` in the superrepo merges a kit change in from it |
| `.test-cabinet-repo.toml` | The name, kind and description, rendered from those answers for the `dependency-edges` gate to read |
| `azure-pipelines.yml` | The pipeline: every gate a step of its own on Azure Pipelines |
| `Cargo.toml` | The workspace root; a crate under `crates/` is a member by being there |

## Rules this repository is held to

- It depends on contracts (crates and packages); engines (crates and packages),
  and on no other repository of the project; the `dependency-edges` gate holds
  every Cargo and npm manifest to the edges the superrepo's Repositories page
  draws.
- It commits its lock file: an application's lock file is the record of the
  revisions that build together. Inside the superrepo every build rewrites the
  working copy under the patch table; that copy is never committed, and
  `scripts/resolve-lock.sh` writes the standalone one back.
- No built artifact is committed. Anything built is derived at build time and
  cached under the build directory.

## Working in this repo (skills)

- Writing code: read the [`coding`](.claude/skills/coding/SKILL.md) skill
  first. It defines Conventional Commits, the gates a change runs, and
  `cargo nextest` over `cargo test`.
- Writing documentation, filing an issue, or draining the queue: the
  superrepo's skills, since the documentation and the board are the
  superrepo's.

## Branches

`master` and `staging` are protected and take pull requests alone, each
approved and with the pipeline passed. `nightly` takes pushes. A push to any
of the three runs the pipeline.
A passing commit of each is pushed to the same branch of the GitHub mirror.

## Building and testing

Everything runs inside the superrepo's devcontainer, from this repository's
root, and one command runs every gate:

```sh
make gate
```

A gate is a file under [`ci/gates/`](ci/README.md) whose stem is its id, run
by the `gate` runner of the `ci` uv project:

```sh
uv run --quiet --project ci gate list         # every gate and what it checks
uv run --quiet --project ci gate run <id>...  # run some of them; --all runs all
```

Run the Rust suite with `cargo nextest`, never the built-in runner: the
retries, the no-fail-fast rule and the per-test timeout are all in
`.config/nextest.toml`.

A build here resolves every dependency on another repository through the
superrepo's `.cargo/config.toml`, which Cargo finds by walking up from this
directory, so the sibling checkouts are what it builds against. The pipeline
builds this repository on its own against the pinned public sources.
